Before applying linear regression, it's important to ensure that certain conditions and assumptions are met to guarantee that the model is appropriate and the results are reliable. Here are the key recommended conditions:





Independence of Errors: The residuals (errors) of the model should be independent of each other. This means there should be no correlation between the residuals. The autocorrelation of residuals can be checked using tests like the Durbin-Watson test.

Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of prediction. In other words, the spread of errors should be roughly the same across all predictions. This can be verified by plotting residuals against fitted values.

Normality of Errors: The residuals should follow an approximately normal distribution. This can be checked using normality tests (such as the Shapiro-Wilk test) or by observing a Q-Q plot of the residuals.



-- GLM: The relationship between the independent (predictor) variables and the dependent (response) variable should be linear. This can be checked through scatter plots or specific tests.

Checking these conditions before applying linear regression ensures that the model is appropriate and that inferences drawn from it are valid. If any of these assumptions are violated, you may need to transform the data or consider a different model.
